# Portfolio
My name is Carmen Vargas and this is my portfolio showcasing my work as a Front-End Web Developer. The project was created using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. I intentionally kept the design simple and clean to ensure that my projects remain the focal point. 

## About Me
I am a Front-End Developer with over five years of experience in web development, specializing in front-end technologies. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science degree in Computer Science with a focus on web development. Before transitioning into web development, I spent 14 years as a high school math teacher. My goal is to combine my experience as an educator with my development skills to pursue a leadership and mentorship role within a development team.
