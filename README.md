# Portfolio
My name is Carmen Vargas and this is my portfolio showcasing my work as a Front-End Web Developer. My portfolio was created using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. I intentionally kept the design simple and clean to ensure that my projects remain the focal point. 

## About Me
I am a front-end developer with over five years of experience specializing in modern web technologies. I hold a Masters of Science degree in Computer Science from Stevens Institute of Technology and bring a unique background as a former high school math teacher with fourteen years of experience. My goal is to combine my strengths as an educator with my technical expertise to grow into a leadership and mentorship role within a development team--where I can support others, foster collaboration, and deliver high-quality solutions.
