					<h2 class="cast_headline">Faeolyn Cassadiel</h2>
					<p>An angel born on the flying lands of Asilia, Faeolyn is the prophesied Element of Air, chosen by the gods to wield the element of air to restore balance to the known world.</p>
					<p>She is the quintessential embodiment of the angelic race with hair as golden as the sun and eyes as blue as the cerelean sky.  Fools are those that are decieved by her celestial beauty; Faeolyn is anything but celestial.  With a tongue sharper than a dragon's scale, she has an unholy drive to purge the known world of all the evil in its dark corners.  By any means necessary.</p>
					<p>And damned be the prophecy, destiny, and anyone or anything that dares to stand in her way.</p>

					<p>An elf born in the beautiful elven city of Elliem, Evelyn is the prophesied Element of Earth, chosen by the gods to wield the element of earth to restore balance to the known world.</p>
					<p>Graceful, kind, and gracious, Evelyn is the epitome of her elven heritage.  But underneath her amiable and gentle manner is an unwavering fortitude and iron-clad will to protect that which she loves most.</p>
					<p>While she will respectfully bow to the wishes of the gods, she will first move mountains, <i>tear</i> them apart if that is what it takes, to protect her family.</p>

					<p>A drakonian with dragon blood running through her veins, Az'ria is the prophesied Element of Fire, chosen by the gods to wield the element of fire to restore balance to the known world.</p>
					<p>Ostracized by the other races for her mixed blood, Az'ria knows only one thing: survival.  By whatever means necessary.  And now that she was well acquainted with Faeolyn, survival also meant defeating the arrogant angel.  That they were sister elements was irrelevant.</p>
					<p>The prophecy and the will of the gods were meaningless to herâ€”what have they ever done for her to earn her undying loyalty?  If using her power over the element of fire would prove once and for all to that odious angel that she was a force to be reckoned with, then so be it.</p>

					<p>A mermaid born off the shores of the Mermaid Sea, Nadyanelle is the prophesied Element of Water, chosen by the gods to wield the element of water to restore balance to the known world.</p>
					<p>Sweet, demure, and caring, Nadyanelle is the glue that holds her makeshift family together.  With no recollection of her past, her element sisters and adoptive family are all that she knows.  All that she holds dear in this world.</p>
					<p>Though she understands her role as the Element of Water and her duty to the gods, it is her family that Nadyanelle wishes to keep.  To protect.</p>
					<p>And she will go to any lengths to ensure that.</p>

				<p>The prophecy foretold of war and hate, of the known world torn apart by the imbalance of light and darkness.  Only four beings, empowered with the ability to wield the elements, would be able to restore balance to the world once again.</p>
				<p>It would seem that fate would dictate the lives of Faeolyn, Evelyn, Nadyanelle, and Az'ria, the four chosen Elements. But our heroines do not abide by the laws of destiny.  And neither do the heroes that join their side.</p>
				<p>Will the delicate balance of good and evil, of light and darkness, withstand the opposition of that which was fated to be?</p>
